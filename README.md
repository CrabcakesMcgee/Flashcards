# Flashcards
## CodeLou_FrontEnd
Description:

My first project. I created a flashcard page that places the questions on the front of the card, and the answers on back. Clicking, or touching the cards via touchscreen flips the cards back-and-forth.


## Custom CSS Classes
Some of the classes I created are:
1. .flashcard - used to style the flashcard on loading. Height, width, margin, etc.
2. .back - used to style the back of the flashcards. Height, width, border radius, and rotation animation.
3. .subtitle - used to change font-size, alignment, etc.


## Custom JavaScript Functions
The javascript functions I created are:
1. Function name: function. The function flips the flashcards when clicked, or when touched via touchscreen.
